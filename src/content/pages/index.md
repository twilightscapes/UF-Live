Take a walk on the wild side and follow along as Todd Lambert goes in search of the creepiest, freakiest, spookiest abandoned and desolate locations.

As a location scout and avid urban explorer, Todd learned to photograph what he sees and to bring the unique subject matter he finds to light. 
<!-- Finding obscure locations and unusual subject matter, Todd has excelled at capturing rarely seen moments of time in unique locations. -->
